            <li>Exploring Team Formation Among Chinese Students in the UK: A Theory of Planned Behaviour - with Ralf Becker, Yidi Sun.
               
            <p>
              This research explores the self-selection of student groups in a second-year economics module, where 50% of the 20 groups consisted exclusively of Chinese students, nine were solely non-Chinese, and only one was mixed. 
              This highlights a preference for homogeneous group formation, particularly among Chinese students. Using Ajzen’s (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour, we examine factors influencing these choices, including attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. 
              Preliminary findings suggest language barriers, academic performance concerns, and cultural differences are key drivers. Our research informs universities on fostering inclusive learning environments through intercultural activities and teaching strategies to enhance collaboration.

            <li>Understanding Undergraduate Students’ Optional Module Choices and Their Academic Consequences in the UK - with Ralf Becker, Yidi Sun.
               
            <p>
              This study aims to understand the mechanisms underlying undergraduate students’ optional module choices. For this purpose, we classify optional modules into quantitative and qualitative categories based on their module outlines and assessment types. 
              First, we examine how undergraduate students select optional modules in their first year. Specifically, we investigate whether students tend to be more quantitative-oriented or qualitative-oriented, defining a student as quantitative-oriented if the number of quantitative modules selected exceeds the number of qualitative modules. 
              Since we do not have access to students’ A-level grades, we will conduct interviews to explore the potential factors influencing their module choices. 
              Second, we analyse whether students’ average grades in first-year quantitative or qualitative optional modules affect their likelihood of selecting quantitative or qualitative modules in the second year, and similarly for the third year. 
              Third, we examine whether consistency in module selection (i.e., consistently choosing qualitative or quantitative optional modules across the three years) is associated with better final GPA outcomes. 
              Finally, we investigate whether home/overseas student status moderates the second and third relationships described above. 
              By improving our understanding of the optional module selection process, this study aims to inform universities on how to better support undergraduate students in choosing optional modules and, ultimately, in achieving stronger academic performance.
