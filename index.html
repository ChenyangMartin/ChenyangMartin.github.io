        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I completed my PhD in Economics at the University of Birmingham (UK) under the supervision of Professor Alessandra Guariglia.
            After completing my PhD in 2021 I worked as a Lecturer in Economics at the University of Reading before joining the University of Manchester as a Teaching Associate in December 2022. 
            Since September 2024, I have been a Lecturer in Econometrics at the University of Manchester, where I primarily teach postgraduate econometrics.
            I love to teach quantiative modules including statistics and econometrics, especially use clear and accessible language to explain complex ideas to help students build strong analytical foundations.
        </p>
            <h2>Resarch interests</h2>
        <p>
            My research mainly focuses on the following areas:
        <p>
            *Liquidity constraints and entrepreneurship in China and the UK, with particular interest in how financial frictions shape entrepreneurial decisions and outcomes. 
        <p>
            *Investor sentiment and stock market dynamics in China, examining how behavioural factors influence market performance.
        <p>
            *Enhancing the formation of heterogeneous study groups among undergraduate and postgraduate students, with the aim of improving cross‑national collaboration and learning (Education Scholarship).
        <p>
            *Supporting UG students in selecting optional modules, focusing on improving the decision‑making process and student experience (Education Scholarship).
